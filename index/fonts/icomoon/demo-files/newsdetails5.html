         <p style="font-size:30px">Kochi: The Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed the Maradu Municipality to refund 
            the entertainment tax levied on unsold tickets of a music concert. Justice Gopinath P stated
            that entertainment tax could only be charged under Section 3 of the Kerala Local Authorities 
            Entertainment Tax Act, 1961 for sold tickets and not on unsold tickets.</p>

         <p style="font-size:30px">The Court's observation came during consideration of a petition by Jose Thomas Performing 
            Arts Center (JTPAC). The JTPAC had organized a music concert within Maradu Municipality's jurisdiction.
            The petitioner complied with the Kerala Local Authorities Entertainment Tax Act, 1961 and Kerala Local 
            Authorities Entertainment Tax Rules, 1962, paying an entertainment tax of Rs 1,24,080, Service Cess of
            Rs 3,102, and a security deposit of Rs 50,000 for 1020 tickets. Each ticket was priced at Rs 600, 
            but only 265 were sold, leaving 755 unsold tickets.</p>
