           Gandhi would
           retain his seat in Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh,

           Wayanad in Kerala where Congress general secretary Priyanka
           Gandhi Vadra,his sister, will make her electoral debut. The
           announcement came after Congress’ top leadership on Monday
           held discussions at party president Mallikarjun Kharge’s residence 
           <b>“You are now going to have two MPs, I will keep visiting,”</b>Rahul said 
           in a message to the people of Wayanad.
           <i>“The people of Wayanad gave me support, the energy to fight at a very difficult time.”</i>
           Addressing the media, Priyanka said, “I won’t let the people of Wayanad feel Rahul’s absence. 
     I     will work hard, try my best to make everyone 
           happy in Wayanad, be a good representative.”</p>
