           The Congress on Monday announced that Rahul Gandhi would
           retain his seat in Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, and give up
           Wayanad in Kerala where Congress general secretary Priyanka
           Gandhi Vadra,his sister, will make her electoral debut. The

           <b>“You are now going to have two MPs, I will keep visiting,”</b>Rahul said 
           in a message to the people of Wayanad.
           <i>“The people of Wayanad gave me support, the energy to fight at a very difficult time.”</i>
           Addressing the media, Priyanka said, “I won’t let the people of Wayanad feel Rahul’s absence. 
     I     will work hard, try my best to make everyone happy in Wayanad, be a good representative.”</p>
