	<h1>Public funds cannot be wasted on projects like Kottayam Skywalk: Ganesh Kumar</h1>

         <div class=thing>
            <p>Thiruvananthapuram: Transport Minister Ganesh Kumar on Wednesday informed the Assembly that the construction
            of the Kottayam Skywalk cannot be carried  out as he believed the project would be a waste of public funds.
            He said the project, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 5 crore, will now require over Rs 17.82 crore 
            to be completed. "The cost will go up if land has to be acquired. Even if the skywalk is built spending 
            so much money, it would have to be demolished for other future development projects in Kottayam," said Ganesh.</p>

        <p>  He said in such a situation, it was not possible to proceed with the construction of the skywalk using the funds
            of the Road Safety Authority. The minister was responding to Congress MLA Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan's 
            demand that the construction of the skywalk is completed at the earliest. "When Thiruvanchoor was the forest minister, 
            he ruthlessly binned a project I had submitted before his department. Please do not think this is my revenge for that rejection," 
            quipped Ganesh.</p>

	 <h1>NEET scam:Kerala Assembly passes unanimous motion against Centre</h1>

        <div class=heads>


         <p>Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala Legislative Assembly on Wednesday stopped short 
            of calling for the restoration of the state-level conduct of the medical entrance
            examination. In a Substantive Motion passed unanimously in the Assembly, the House 
            reminded the Centre that the state had conducted complaint-free pre-medical tests 
            earlier but, however, did not urge the NDA government to give back the states their 
            former right to conduct the medical entrance test.</p>

         <p>Through the motion, the House expressed its general sense that the National Testing Agency (NTA) 
            has once again demonstrated that it is incapable of conducting in an impeccable and trustworthy 
            manner examinations that decide the future of lakhs of students in the country "It was after ending the 
            medical entrance exams that were conducted in an unimpeachable manner by states that the centre 
            introduced NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)," the motion said.</p>


          <p>"The House strongly disapproves of the Union government's decision to stand by the NTA that
             has by its negligence and incompetence thrown lakhs of students who had taken the exam in Kerala,
             and their parents, into the depths of uncertainty and endangered their future," it said. 
             The motion urged the Union government to take immediate steps to remove the fears and concerns 
             of students and their parents. The motion criticised the Centre for taking the stand that there 
             was no proof of question paper leak. "But after this, the NET also had to be cancelled following 
             the detection of irregularities. In addition to this, NEET-PG and CSIR-NET exams were also cancelled," 
             the motion said. </p>
