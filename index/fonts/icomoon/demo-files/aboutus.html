    <p style="font-size:30px">A newspaper website typically serves as an online platform where users can access news articles, 
    	editorials, and other content previously available in print form. These websites often feature 
        sections dedicated to various topics such as politics, business, sports, and entertainment.
        They provide timely updates, multimedia elements like videos and images, and sometimes interactive 
        features like polls or comment sections for reader engagement. Newspaper websites aim to provide 
        comprehensive coverage of local, national, and international news while adapting to digital trends
        by offering mobile-friendly layouts and social media integration.</p>
