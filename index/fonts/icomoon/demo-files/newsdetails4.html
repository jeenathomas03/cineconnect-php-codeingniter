           <h1>Public funds cannot be wasted on projects like Kottayam Skywalk: Ganesh Kumar</h1>

         <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Ganeshkumar" style="float:left;width:700px;height:700px;">

         <p>Thiruvananthapuram: Transport Minister Ganesh Kumar on Wednesday informed the Assembly that the construction
            of the Kottayam Skywalk cannot be carried  out as he believed the project would be a waste of public funds.
            He said the project, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 5 crore, will now require over Rs 17.82 crore 
            to be completed. "The cost will go up if land has to be acquired. Even if the skywalk is built spending 
            so much money, it would have to be demolished for other future development projects in Kottayam," said Ganesh.</p>

        <p>  He said in such a situation, it was not possible to proceed with the construction of the skywalk using the funds
            of the Road Safety Authority. The minister was responding to Congress MLA Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan's 
            demand that the construction of the skywalk is completed at the earliest. "When Thiruvanchoor was the forest minister, 
            he ruthlessly binned a project I had submitted before his department. Please do not think this is my revenge for that rejection," 
            quipped Ganesh.</p>
